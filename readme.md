This Project was worked upon by Venkateshwaran Sundar and Karan Shah.
To run the project, make sure the url to live feed is updated, and a path for CSV file is correct. Both these updates are to be made in the code.
Once the project is running, live feed will show segmented image, with regions applied. Press n, to add object to training data. A prompt in console will ask for region id and the label.
On the live feed, press f find the closes match for the object. Prompt on console will ask for region id to be matched with training data.
On the live feed, press k find the closes match for the object using KNN. Prompt on console will ask for region id to be matched with training data.
Both match operations will label the object on live feed. To switch from output to live feed press any key(other than n,f).
Press q(twice) to quit.

The extension in this project is to label Unkown objects.

We've used 3 late days, and few more "Stuff happens" days.
